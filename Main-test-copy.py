To Do:
    battle mode function (displays battle mode option when applicable but have yet to make a function that starts the actual battle)
    implement battle mode function in main code
    add key parameter to boss NPCs
    figure out display text for rooms after bosses are defeated
    alternative description/blurbs for storage
    extra actions for each room
    120/130 divider stuff
    fix storage description issue (nurse's office)
