# Escape-HTHS
In Escape HTHS, the user plays an HTHS student who has been trapped at school and must escape by collecting items throughout the classrooms and defeating bosses.

When you enter the game, you will first be asked for your name. Any String will be accepted for this.

Whenever you are in a room with a boss, you will have the option to choose one of four actions:

“battle” — enter “battle” in order to engage in battle with the boss

“stats” — view your player stats

“Items” — view your items

“leave” — leave the room


If you are in a room without a boss, or the boss has been the defeated, “battle” will no longer be an available option, but other options will be available:

“storage name” — enter the name of any storage item and you will be able to view the items within the storage. A list of storage items in the room will be provided.


While in battle, you will have the option to choose one of five actions:

“attack” — attack the boss with your chosen weapon

“heal” — use a bandaid to heal yourself

“stats” — view your player stats (your hp)

“flee” — flee the room

“change weapon” — change your weapon


Enter whatever is in quotes, when prompted, in order to perform an action.

To select an item, enter the name of the item (before the colon).

When a question is asked and (y/n) is printed after it, enter either “y” or “n” in order to answer the question appropriately, when prompted.

Inputs are not case-sensitive.
